                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, 
                is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird.
                A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. 
                The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, 
                or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most 
                common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources 
                common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.</p>

                <h2>Beef</h2>
                <p> Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, 
                    short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), 
                    while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually
                    mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. 
                    The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage.</p>

                <h2>Sushi</h2>
                <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice usually with some sugar 
                and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. 
                Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi".Sushi is traditionally
                made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. </p>
